        <h1>StylMore</h1>
        <p>StylMore is a lightweight CSS framework built with Stylus. It is designed to be a minimal foundation to help jump start new projects, implement responsive designs and promote best practices. StylMore was created as an alternative to other CSS frameworks which lack flexibility because they try to create a finished product. StylMore's philosophy is to help you design better and faster, not design for you.</p>
